Design a dark fantasy web layout for the Character Sheets section of a Dungeons of Drakkenheim WordPress theme, following the same structure and art direction as the landing page.
The aesthetic remains gothic-steampunk and painterly, matching the style of the Drakkenheim campaign manual: visible brushstrokes, brass filigree, parchment textures, and violet-green glow effects.
No text; show only layout composition and placeholders for images, headers, and interactive areas.

🔮 Header

Identical to the landing page header.

Full-width hero banner with drifting fog texture, muted violet light, and a faint silhouette of Drakkenheim’s skyline.

Centered metallic embossed title: “DUNGEONS OF DRAKKENHEIM”.

Above or beside it, a logo emblem (brass ring enclosing a glowing delirium crystal).

Below, a thin brass divider line separating the header from the body content.

Palette: black steel, smoke gray, copper, and faint luminous violet.

⚙️ Character Gallery Section (below the header)

Three (or more) large rectangular cards arranged horizontally, each representing a character.

Each card framed in engraved brass with subtle alchemical filigree in the corners.

Inside each frame:

A portrait placeholder (illustration of the character).

Below it, a small nameplate area — a brass plate placeholder for the character’s name (no text).

When hovered, each frame emits a soft violet or green inner glow (delirium light).

The gallery should be scrollable or expandable, accommodating multiple characters per player (at least 3 per row).

Background: dark parchment with faint ink stains and geometric runes fading into fog.

📜 Character Sheet Display (dynamic section below gallery)

Occupies the entire width of the screen below the gallery.

The sheet appears when a character portrait is selected.

Framed area styled like an open alchemical codex page:

Double-page parchment texture with ornamental brass corners.

The center spine slightly shadowed, as if part of a physical tome.

Subtle overlays of alchemical circles, runes, and faint violet glow.

The parchment area is mostly blank for WordPress content embedding (to insert the actual character sheet later).

Border details: engraved copper filigree, faint scratches, and magical sigils barely visible.

Ambient lighting: soft warm highlights around the parchment, fading into cooler tones near the screen edges.

🧩 Interactivity (visual layout only)

When a character image is selected from the gallery above, the corresponding sheet slides or fades into view directly below.

The previous sheet fades into shadow.

Keep transitions smooth and subtle, as if pages of a magical book turning.

🎨 Color Palette & Mood

Base: dark parchment, blackened bronze, and ash-gray.

Accents: aged copper, faint violet and green luminescence, muted gold.

Lighting: soft, moody, candlelit glow with reflections of violet light on metal frames.

Mood: arcane, organized, yet personal — this is the player’s sanctum within the grim world of Drakkenheim.

🧩 WordPress Structural Mapping

Header area: reused from landing page (site identity).

Character gallery: grid layout with custom post type “Character” → each image links dynamically to its sheet below.

Character sheet area: single block region (e.g., custom field display or embedded PDF/HTML sheet).

Ensure spacing and padding mirror the landing design for seamless navigation.

⚗️ Style Summary

The page must feel like turning the pages of a living grimoire — brass, parchment, magic, and mystery.
Every frame, glow, and detail should reinforce the identity of Drakkenheim: scholarly, dark, alchemical, and beautiful in decay.
