Design a dark fantasy landing page layout inspired by Dungeons of Drakkenheim, intended for a WordPress theme.
The page must blend gothic atmosphere with modular web structure: a cinematic header with fog and logo, followed by three feature blocks (character sheet, campaign journal, wiki), and finally a feed section showing the latest campaign journal entries.
No body text — use layout placeholders and UI composition only.

🔮 Header

Full-width top section styled like a cinematic banner.

Centered title text placeholder: “DUNGEONS OF DRAKKENHEIM”, embossed metallic lettering.

Above or beside it: circular logo placeholder — a brass emblem enclosing a glowing violet delirium crystal or stylized tower silhouette.

Behind: animated fog or static mist texture drifting across a ruined city skyline, lit by faint violet and green light.

Palette: blackened steel, muted purples, faint emerald highlights.

Mood: mysterious, solemn, and epic — like the opening of a dark fantasy chronicle.

🧭 Navigation Bar

Positioned directly beneath the header.

Long brass horizontal band, engraved with faint runes and edge filigree.

No text or buttons — only visual placeholders for future WordPress nav items.

Subtle inner glow on hover zones.

⚙️ Three Feature Blocks

Immediately below the navigation bar, display three large framed panels arranged horizontally (responsive grid that stacks on mobile).

Each panel follows the Drakkenheim manual style — painterly, textured, with ornate copper borders and dark parchment backgrounds.
Inside each, a centered icon placeholder and space for future title/text content.

Character Sheets Block

Icon: brass grimorio or mask motif.

Background hint: aged parchment with faint stat-grid overlay.

Accent glow: soft violet.

Campaign Journal Block

Icon: quill crossed with a delirium shard.

Background hint: parchment with faint map outlines or ink blotches.

Accent glow: copper-amber.

Lore Wiki Block

Icon: compass rose encircling a crystal.

Background hint: faded runes and geometric diagrams.

Accent glow: pale green.

Add soft vignette shadows beneath each card. On hover, edges brighten in brass tones and icon halos glow faintly.

📜 Latest Journal Entries Feed

Full-width section below the three blocks, styled as a continuous parchment strip.

Each entry placeholder appears as a framed card within the strip — parchment panels with torn or burned edges, faint violet stains, and copper corners.

Arrange 3–4 entries visible side-by-side (scrollable horizontally or fade carousel).

Each entry card has space for a thumbnail, date label, and excerpt placeholder (no text content).

Background: darker parchment fading to black toward edges; faint drifting fog overlay.

Mood: feels like flipping through the physical pages of an adventurer’s chronicle.

🎨 Visual Style & Palette

Art style: Drakkenheim campaign manual — painterly fantasy UI with visible brushwork and high-contrast chiaroscuro.

Palette: blackened parchment, dark umber, aged copper, muted violet and green luminescence (delirium glow).

Materials: brass, leather, ink, smoke, and crystal light textures.

Lighting: moody but readable, warm copper highlights balanced by cool mystical tones.

Typography placeholders: serif ornamental (e.g., Cinzel / Cormorant), embossed metallic texture (no actual text).

🧩 Structure for WordPress Adaptation

Header area: hero banner (Site Title + Logo).

Navigation bar: standard WordPress menu region (no buttons shown).

Feature section: three linked cards (can map to custom post types).

Journal feed: dynamic block pulling from latest posts.

Layout spacing generous; backgrounds and blocks clearly separated by tone, not borders.

⚗️ Mood Summary

The overall feel should evoke entering a living codex — atmospheric, elegant, modular.
A world between knowledge and decay, science and magic.
The fog, copper frames, and delirium light unify every element into one cohesive Drakkenheim-style experience.
